## Different Projects Data Science, Statistics
Here I only show the final draft of the projects, mainly pdf files

* ### Project 1 - R: Exploring the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset
  **Research Questions:**
    * Q1: How is the general health among the USA population for females and males
    * Q2: How are the weigth, height and Body Mass Index (BMI) distributions among USA females and
males:
    * Q3: Which factor has a greater impact on health BMI or Education ?

  **Research Question:**
    * Q: Does different races think differently about being theirself more or less Liberal or
Conservative?

* ### Project 3 - R: Linear Regresson: Modelling Spectators Films's ratings vs. Popularity
  **Research questions:**
  * Q1: What can the data tell us. Particularities and possible relationships between variables.
  * Q2: Can we  nd some parameter that correlates with high ratings.
  * Q3: What attributes make a movie popular.
  * Q4: She is also interested in learning something new about movies.
  * Q5: We would like to buy  lms for “our” tv channel that the most audience would like. Can we  nd a model that gives the
rating people will give the movie. It is high rating eneough for determining if the  lm is going to be popular?
